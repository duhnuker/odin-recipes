# odin-recipes
This current project is a basic HTML recipe website using the knowledge I have learnt from all previous lessons on TheOdinProject.
This will be very basic, just to ensure complete understanding of HTML, and Git commands.

What skills were used: Knowledge of the HTML boilerplate, linking multiple pages to the index page, using the correct tags for content insertion and overall
keeping neat code were used.

Final self-reflection of project: My understanding of the basic HTML boilerplate, tags and syntax is pretty good currently, and will only be improved upon.
I didn't run into any problems with this project.
