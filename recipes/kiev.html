    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p1>Chicken Kiev (Ukrainian: котлета по-київськи, kotleta po-kyivsky; Russian: котлета по-киевски, kotleta po-kiyevski, literally "cutlet Kyiv-style")[note 1]
        or Chicken Kyiv is a dish made of chicken fillet pounded and rolled around cold butter, then coated with egg and bread crumbs,
        and either fried or baked. Stuffed chicken breast is generally known in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines as côtelette de volaille. Since fillets are
        often referred to as suprêmes in professional cookery, the dish is also called suprême de volaille à la Kiev. Though it has disputed origins,
        the dish is particularly popular in the post-Soviet states, as well as in several other countries of the former Eastern Bloc, and in
        the English-speaking world.

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Garlic butter filling: Place ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape and chill butter: Scrape butter on to a small sheet of baking / parchment paper and roughly shape into 10 x 6cm / 4 x 2.4" rectangle.
            Refrigerate until firm, then cut in half lengthwise to form two batons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pound chicken: Place chicken smooth side down between two freezer bags or paper (Note 3). Pound to an even 0.5 cm / 0.2" thickness using a meat
            mallet (Note 4 for tips!)
        </li>
        <li>
            Season: Sprinkle each side of the chicken with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Stuff and roll up chicken: Place a baton of butter in the middle. Trim edges if needed, then add trimmings into the centre.
            Fold sides in over the butter, then roll the chicken up starting from the bottom, finishing with the seam side down.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap and partially freeze: Wrap the chicken log in cling wrap, twisting the ends tightly to create a firm log shape. Place in the freezer for
            30 minutes until the surface is fairly firm to touch, but not frozen solid. (Note 5)
        </li>
        <li>
            Crumb: Place egg, flour and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Coat chicken in flour, shaking off excess. Coat in egg, drip off excess.
            Then coat in breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere.
        </li>
        <li>
            Partial freeze: Place crumbed chicken in the freezer for 30 minutes until fairly firm to handle (but not frozen solid).
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F. Place a rack on a tray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry: Heat oil in a heavy based pot to 190°C / 375°F. Carefully place chicken in the oil and cook, turning once or twice, until golden (2 – 3 minutes).
            It will still be raw inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake: Place chicken on a rack and bake for 15 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken is 65°C / 150°F.
            Pierce the top so you don't cause butter leakage!
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest for 2 minutes, then serve, sprinkled with a pinch of parsley if desired!
        </li>
    </ol>
