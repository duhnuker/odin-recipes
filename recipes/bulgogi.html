    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p1>Bulgogi (불고기; /bʊlˈɡoʊɡiː/ bool-GOH-gee;[2] from Korean bul-gogi [pul.ɡo.ɡi]), literally "fire meat", is a gui (구이;
        Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue
        or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket are frequently
        used cuts of beef for the dish. The dish originated from northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, but is a very popular dish
        in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless rib eye steak</li>
        <li>1/2 small pear, peeled and coarsely grated</li>
        <li>1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Wrap steak in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and gochujang. In a gallon size Ziploc bag,
            combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat.* Working in batches, add steak to the grill pan in a 
            single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side.
            Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and steak.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
